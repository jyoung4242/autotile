# Auto Tiling Demonstration, using ExcaliburJS

The purpose of this small demo is to demonstrate an algorithm for using bitmasks and sprite sheet swapping to redraw a tile map for a
game.

This allows for the appropriate section of the sprite sheet to be used based on the neighbor tiles are configured as walkable or not.

## Instructions:

left mouse click: draw walkable paths into the tile map.

right mouse click: draw un-walkable (undo) into the tile map.

Using the controls above let's you reset and start over, or swap out the sprite sheets used for the tilemap.
